<b>Our project aim </b>is to determine the impact of Covid-19 on 9 stocks across following industries:

* Hospitality
* Aviation
* Entertainment
* Technology 
* Telecommunications

We will track prices of these stocks from the 1st of January 2020 to the 4th of December 2020 and then compare it to the previous time from 2019. 

One we have done this we will identify if the fluctuations in prices correspond with key events during Covid-19 such as the first case of Covid-19.

<b>Hypothesis:</b>

We hypothesis that fluctuations of stock prices are strongly correlated with key events in Covid-19 such as lockdowns and that the correlation has weakened as time has gone.

<b>What We Are Using:</b>

For this project we will be using PostgreSQL and SQlAlchemy to assemble and query the data, ElephantSQL to collaborate and manage changes to the SQL code and Github as the repository.


<b>Our Sources of Data:</b>

- Yahoo Finance where we will obtain the CSVâ€™s for the stock prices on a day to day basis
- Global News which provides a timeline which we will take and convert into a CSV. (https://globalnews.ca/news/6859636/ontario-coronavirus-timeline/)
